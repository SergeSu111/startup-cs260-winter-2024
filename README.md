## Elevator Pitch

My startup project is for categorizing and discovering different useful websites. My project solves the problem that most people want to find a solution or website for their needs on the web, but they don't know how to start searching, my project pinpoints and finds the websites that users may want to search based on their needs. My website targets a wide range of users. It's useful to everyone on the Internet. Because I will be putting more and more different types of websites and categories on my site in the future. So it will be useful for almost everyone, depending on their needs.
